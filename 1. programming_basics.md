# Introduction

## What is a program?

Program makes computer usable. A computer without programs can't do anything, being nothing but an object. Programs enable computers to perform complex tasks, however, the computer doesn't understand the semantics that a program consists of as how human would understand it. Therefore, it is necessary for human, or the program developers to instruct the computers with proper **Programming Language** to eventually come up with a program.

## Programming Language

### What is machine language?

Human uses language to communicate and understand each other. Similarly, computers use **Machine Language** to understand and represent objects and instructions. However, even the most advanced computers nowadays is simply a machine that follows some certain instructions, ie. a set of known and pre-defined commands. From the computer's perspective, such commands are very simple and straightforward. For example, there could be 3 commands saying 'take the input parameter which is a number; multiple that number by 4; and save the result in memory'.

### Component of a Language

Typically, machine language, programming language or even a human natural language such as English has the following 4 components.

- Alphabet: a set of symbols used to build words or commands
- Lexis: a set of words or commands that a language offers, like a dictionary
- Syntax: a set of rules to determine if a list of words or commands forms a valid sentence or statement
- Semantics: a set of rules to determine if a sentence or statement makes sense

### Instruction List of Machine Language

For a computer, a complete set of known symbols, ie. the alphabet of a machine language is called an **Instruction List (IL)** and different types of computers may have different size or instructions of their IL depending on the computer model. This is the most primary set of symbols that we use to give commands to a computer.

### High-Level Programming Language

Unfortunately, the mother tongue of a computer, ie. the machine language is too different from a human understandable language and we need something else as a language for human and developer to write and for machines to understand so that a program can be implemented by us and executed by a computer. These languages are called **high-level programming language**.

To some extent, those programming languages might look similar to the natural languages that human use and understand. They contains symbols, words and conventions which are readable to humans and such languages enable human to express commands and write programs much more easily than using a bare metal machine language.

Here are some exmaples of high-level programming languages:

- Python
- Java
- C#
- GoLang
- JavaScript

With the high-level programming language,
