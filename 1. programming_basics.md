# Introduction

## What is a program?

Program makes computer usable. A computer without programs can't do anything, being nothing but an object. Programs enable computers to perform complex tasks, however, the computer doesn't understand the semantics that a program consists of as how human would understand it. Therefore, it is necessary for human, or the program developers to instruct the computers with proper **Programming Language** to eventually come up with an executable program.

## Programming Language

### What is machine language?

Human uses language to communicate and understand each other. Similarly, computers use **Machine Language** to understand and represent objects and instructions. However, even the most advanced computers nowadays is simply a machine that follows some certain instructions, ie. a set of known and pre-defined commands. From the computer's perspective, such commands are very simple and straightforward. For example, there could be 3 commands saying 'take the input parameter which is a number; multiple that number by 4; and save the result in memory'.

### Component of a Language

Typically, machine language, programming language or even a human natural language such as English has the following 4 components.

- Alphabet: a set of symbols used to build words or commands
- Lexis: a set of words or commands that a language offers, like a dictionary
- Syntax: a set of rules to determine if a list of words or commands forms a valid sentence or statement
- Semantics: a set of rules to determine if a sentence or statement makes sense

### Instruction List of Machine Language

For a computer, a complete set of known symbols, ie. the alphabet of a machine language is called an **Instruction List (IL)** and different types of computers may have different size or instructions of their IL depending on the computer model. This is the most primary set of symbols that we use to give commands to a computer.

### High-Level Programming Language

Unfortunately, the mother tongue of a computer, ie. the machine language is too different from a human understandable language and we need something else as a language for human and developer to write and for machines to understand so that a program can be implemented by us and executed by a computer. These languages are called **high-level programming language**.

To some extent, those programming languages might look similar to the natural languages that human use and understand. They contains symbols, words and conventions which are readable to humans and such languages enable human to express commands and write programs much more easily than using a bare metal machine language.

Here are some exmaples of different languages in computer science world:

| Language             | Type       | Description |
| --------             | ----       | ----------- |
| Python               | High Level | General purpose, eg. data analysis, deep learning, web server, etc. |
| Java                 | High Level | General purpose. Popular for enterprise-level applicaiton development. |
| C#                   | High Level | General purpose. Part of Microsoft .NET ecosystem. Popular for enterprise-level application development. |
| GoLang               | High Level | General purpose. Popular for high-concurrency and performance-oriented web server development. |
| JavaScript           | High Level | Popular for web application frontend development, eg. website user interface. |
| Assembly Language    | Low Level  | certain representations of machine instructions, eg. x86-ASM |
| Machine Code         | Low Level  | binary instructions directly exeucuted by CPU |


With the high-level programming language, the program that developers write is called **Source Code**, in contrast to the **Machine Code** that is executed by computers. The file containing the source code is called a **Source File**.

#### Compilation and Interpretation
As a developer, after writing a program with your favorite programming language, how can you run it and how does things work under the hood? The answer is you'll have to firstly convert and transform the program into machine language. Fortunately, this process is well handled by a computer itself in the following two ways.

##### Compilation
The source program is translated once and the output file (converted file) can be used to run your source program or distributed to some other people, eg. a .exe file in Microsoft Windows system. Everytime you make changes to your source program, you will have to re-compile it. The program handling the transformation is called a compiler.

##### Interpretation
The source program is translated on the fly while it is being executed. You don't have to compile to run it and you can simply distribute the source code or source file to other people. The program handling the transformation is called a interpreter. Of course, people want to run your program must also have a interpreter in order to do in-time translation.

When your source programs execute in this mode, the interpreter simply reads your source file (which must be a pure text file) from top to bottom and from left to right. For each line it scans through, if the alphabet, lexis, syntax and semantics are all correct, it will execute it, otherwise, it throws an error with detailed message. Hence, it is possible that the program has executed from line 1 to line 100 and on line 101 there's an error thrown.

##### Compilation vs Interpretation
|      | Compilation | Interpretation |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Pros | Execution of translated code is usually faster. Only the developer has to use compiler to compile the program. The end-user may run the program without a compiler. The translated code is stored as machine language when other people receive them. It is hard for other people to peek your internal implementation of the source code. | There's no additional translation step to run your source code. Source code is stored as programming language so that it can be executed on computers with different machine languages or architectures. There's no need to compile source code separately for different architecture. |
| Cons | The compilation step requires computation resources and might be time consuming. Each time you make changes to your program source code, you'll have to re-compile it. You will have to compile it as many times (potentially with different compilers) as the hardware platforms that you want your program to run on. | Runtime code interpretation wouldn't make your program performance too high. The end user of your program need to have a interpreter to run your program. |

#### Type of High-Level Programming Languages
Typically, most of the modern high-level programming languages fall into either one of the two categories, ie. either compiled or interpreted. There are certain languages which might involve both compilation and interpretation due to its internal implementation. As an example, Java source programs will be compiled into .class files which are intermediate bytecode files which is then sent to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for interpretation. However, we typically classify such languages as compiled languages as well because there's always a must-happen compilation process in order to run or distribute the program.

# Python
As an example, we use Python to illustrate some programming basics. Python is a high-level programming language and you can achieve a lot with relatively minimal code compared to other languages such as Java or C#. It is intuitive and easy to learn and has powerful programming features. Python is an interpreted programming language and it is very popular for machine learning and AI development.

## Python Implementations
### What is a Python implementation?
Based on [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations), a Python impelentation is a program or environment providing support for the execution of programs written in Python language, as represented by the CPython reference implementation.

### CPython
The very first version or the traditional version of the Python implementation is called **CPython** (a Python reference implementaiton). Its author Guido van Rossum is the president of the community Python Software Foundation (PSF) which aims to develop, improve, expand and popularize Python. All other Python implementation follows the standards estabished by PSF. CPython enables Python to be ported and migrated to all platforms which support C language compilation and execution. Typically when your run a source program with CPython, CPython will firstly parse your .py source files into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the program's structure. The AST is then compiled into a sequence of bytecode instructions (compact and platform-independent) cached as .pyc files in the `__pycache__` directory.  Next, CPython's C-based virtual machine (VM) starts interpreting the bytecode by reading each opcode and executing the corresponding C function (in ceval.c). You can imagine the intepreter of CPython has two components, where the first component - compiler frontend, parses your .py source files to AST, then to bytecode and the second component - CPython VM, which is the eval loop will read and execute the generated bytecode instructions.

Most of the time, this is the Python implementation that we'll be using to develop softwares, AI models and perform data analysis.

### Other Implementations and Extensions
| Software | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Cython | Cython is a optimising Python-to-C compiler, CPython extension module generator and wrapper language for binding external librareis. It interacts with CPython runtime and supports embedding CPython in standalone binaries. It improves efficiency of program execution by auto-translating Python code into C code. |
| Jython | Jython is a Python implementation in Java for the Java platform. It enables developers to add some Python flexibility to an existing large and complex systems implemented using Java. The current Jython implementation follows Python 2 standards. There's no Jython conforming to Python 3 so far. |
| PyPy | PyPy is a Python implementation written in RPython (restricted Python). In PyPy, the source code is not executed in the interpretation manner, instead it's translated into C code and executed separately. PyPy is considered rather a tool for people developing Python itself. |
| MicroPython | MicroPython is a Python implementation that runs on microcontrollers. It consists of a small subset of the Python Standard Library and large number of features to support low-level access to the hardware. |

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
To write a program, as the first step, you need to set up your development environment. Here, I'm using my personal preference as an example, but feel free to use other tools as you become more familar with software development.
| Software | Purpose | Download |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Visual Studio Code (VSCode) | VSCode is a super popular text editor with rich community support and extensions to customize your coding experience. As a developer, you write Python source code in VSCode. As larger enterprise-level projects might use other IDEs such as PyCharm, it is always a good practice to start from the basics and understand how things work before switching to a more advanced tool that handles automation and shortcuts for you. | You may download the latest version from Microsoft official website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). |
| Python 3.9+ | This refers to the CPython implementation with version 3.9 and above. It contains a full CPython distribution consisting of a C-based executable (python or python3) that handles bytecode parsing and execution, the Python standard libraries (all the Python built-in modules compiled as C extensions or pure-Python packages) and tools such as pip, venv, idle and other utilities bundled with the CPython reference implementation. | To download and install Python on macOS, I strongly recommend using Homebrew which is a powerful software package manager that helps you download packages from online sources and manage packages locally on your machine. To install homebrew, see [here](./homebrew.md). To install Python 3.9, open up a terminal and run `brew install python@3.9`.  |

### Python Environment
With both VSCode and Python installed, now we need to create a Python environment to start your project. A Python environment is nothing but an isolated workspace that contains its own Python interpreter and a set of installed packages. It is always a good practice to create a new Python environment for a new project or just to test out some ideas that suddenly come into your mind, so that your Python environments for different projects are completely separate and isolated to avoid potential version conflicts. As an example, you have two projects A and B where A requires Python@3.9, some-other-library@0.1 and B requires Python@3.10, some-other-library@0.2. It'll be super messy if you use the same Python environment for both of the projects, as you will end up installing and uninstalling different package versions each time you switch to another project.

To create a Python environment, there are severals tools and each has its own strength and limitations. Following are some popular tools which you might use. For simplicity, let's use the built-in venv tool bundled with the CPython distribution with version 3.3 and above.

| Tool | Description | Usage |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **venv** | This is the built-in venv module that is part of the standard library of CPython from version 3.3 onwards. | `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9 -m venv venv`, this creates a virtual environment folder called venv in your current folder. Typically it contains 2 subfolders bin and lib where bin consists of a isolated Python 3.9 (python), a package installation tool (pip) and activate script to active the python env in your terminal. Now run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the environment so that the python and pip commands that you execute later in the terminal refers to this virtual environment. |
| **virtualenv** | Standalone tool supporting older Pythons and extra hooks | `pip install virtualenv`<br>`virtualenv <env_name>` |
| **pipenv**  | Combines Pipfile dependency management with virtualenv | `pip install pipenv`<br>`pipenv install` (creates env)<br>`pipenv shell` |
| **Poetry**  | Dependency manager & packager with auto-created venvs | See [here](./poetry.md) for more details of poetry. |
| **Conda**   | Cross-language binary package manager with environment isolation | `conda create -n <env_name> python=3.x`<br>`conda activate <env_name>` |

### Configure your Python Environment in IDE
Follow the steps below to configure the VSCode to point to the Python interpreter created.
- Open up your VSCode and press &#x2318; + &#x21E7; + P to open up the command palette. Here we can search and execute the VSCode editor command.
- Now type 'Python: Select Interpreter' and enter
- Select the auto-detected python interpreter for the virtual environment created. If it doesn't show up, click on 'Enter interpreter path...' and type in the full path to the python interpreter of the virual environment (this refers to the interpreter file - python or python3 or python3.9, under the bin directory).

Upon completing this section, we are ready to start writing Python code.

## Your First Python Program!
In this section, let's start writing your first program in Python and try to execute it. We will use the Python environments you created earlier, so please make sure you have completed the previous sections.

Now in your project root folder under which you have created the virtual environment folder, create a file named `main.py`. In the file, type `print("Hello, World!")` and save it.


Open up a new integrated terminal by pressing &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + \`. Run `source ./venv/bin/activate` to activate your python environment in the current terminal.

Run `python ./main.py` to execute your program. You are expected to see a message `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.

Congratulations on your first big achievement! Here's what happened.
- You have created a Python source file named `main.py`.
- You have written a line of Python source code `print("Hello, World!")`.
- This line of source code forms a statement as part of your program. As you write more codes in the future, there will be more statements and expressions in your source code.
- The statement calls a Python built-in library named `print()` and you have provided an argument which is a string literal `"Hello, World!"`.
- The built-in function `print()` receives your argument and prints it to the standard output stream which points to your terminal, hence you see it upon execution.
